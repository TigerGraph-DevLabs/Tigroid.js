# Tigroid.js
JavaScript connector for TigerGraph

!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

This connector is intended to work both in browsers and on server side, to be Node.JS friendly (in the long term).

TODO:
* DML functions (upserting/deleting vertices and edges)
* Async operations
* Authentication and security improvements
* Testing
* Documentation (in the meantime, you can use the [pyTigerGraph reference](https://github.com/szb-tg/pyTigerGraph/blob/master/docs/Functions.md), almost the same functional interface)
